    <textOnly>At this point in the process, you&apos;ve made it all the way through the installation and energizing of your solar system, which means your system should be on and operational!



Please click Energize System to log-in and watch a quick video on how to turn on your system through your Palmetto Home app.



After your system is turned on, you will notice that your Palmetto Home app has changed to your Production Tracker dashboard. This new view allows you to see how well your solar system is producing energy on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.



Please click Production Tracker to log-in and watch a short video on how to navigate through your updated dashboard in your Palmetto Home app.



Once you have learned how to navigate through your Palmetto Home app, you will have access to  short clips that can answer questions like:

How do I prepare my system for a hurricane?

What happens if I sell my home?

How do I file my solar tax credits?

How do I view my consumption details? (only for homeowners who added this product)




Also, if you’re interested in any of our continued service, please message us in your Palmetto Home app’s chat feature.



If you know someone interested in solar, please reach out to us as we would be thrilled to help them switch seamlessly towards a clean energy future.



We hope you are enjoying your solar system and we look forward to continuing our relationship with you!



Thank you,
