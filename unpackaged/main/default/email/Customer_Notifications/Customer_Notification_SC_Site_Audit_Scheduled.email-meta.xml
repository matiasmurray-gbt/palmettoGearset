    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

Your site audit has been scheduled for {!Opportunity.Site_Survey_Time__c}.

The site audit should take 1-2 hours and involves our team reviewing the roof, attic &amp; electrical equipment so that we don&apos;t have any surprises install day. 

Any additional aesthetic requests can be shared with customer.care@palmetto.com and will be addressed before installation. The construction manager will review all of these details with you on site the morning of your installation to make sure we are all on the same page before beginning construction.

Best Regards,

Palmetto Customer Care Team
