    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},


Now that we have all of the correct permits and approvals it&apos;s time for us to install your solar system! If we havenâ€™t done so already we&apos;ll be reaching out soon to schedule the date of your installation.



At this point in the process we are also ordering your equipment, ensuring we have everything we need for the big day.



In the meantime, please be on the lookout for a phone call from our scheduling team. And as always. if you have any questions, reach out to us through your Palmetto Home app feature or give us a call.



Thank you,

Palmetto Customer Care
