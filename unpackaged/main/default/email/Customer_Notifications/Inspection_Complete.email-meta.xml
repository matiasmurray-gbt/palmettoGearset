    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},



Your county inspection has been completed and approved! The utility provider now has 14 business days to install your meter.



You do not have to be home for this inspection unless your meter is located within your home or unreachable due to an obstruction.



Furthermore, if your meter is behind a fence or gate, please make arrangements to have the gate unlocked and free of pets. This will allow the inspector to easily access your meter.



Once your meter is installed, we will provide you a short instructional video on how to turn on your new solar system! If you need more assistance, feel free to give us a call and we will walk you through our simple 3 step process.



**If you’re financing your system, you should not receive your payment for the system until it is on and operating**



Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us in your Palmetto Home chat feature or by calling us at the number listed below.



Thank you,

Palmetto Customer Care
