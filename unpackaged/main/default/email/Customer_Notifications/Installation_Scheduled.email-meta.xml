    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},


Congratulations, we have finalized your installation date for {!Opportunity.Installation_Start_Date__c}. Please take a moment to review what you should look forward to the day of the installation.


What To Expect:


We will arrive between 8 AM- 11 AM to get started unless notified otherwise.



Larger systems may take up to 2 days to complete. Upon scheduling, we will go over what you should expect.



It is MANDATORY that a trusted individual is available for the entirety of the installation.



In most cases, we will need a clear pathway to access your attic.



Keep all vehicles, obstructions, and personal items out of the driveway during the installation, to ensure they are safe from falling debris.



PLEASE clear the yard of all animal waste to prevent our team from tracking it into your home.



Installations are weather dependent. Any extreme weather conditions, including heavy rain, will be rescheduled to ensure the safety of our team and your home.



We look forward to getting your installation scheduled. Please be on the lookout for a phone call from our scheduling team.  If you have any questions, reach out to us through your Palmetto Home app feature or give us a call.


Thank you,
