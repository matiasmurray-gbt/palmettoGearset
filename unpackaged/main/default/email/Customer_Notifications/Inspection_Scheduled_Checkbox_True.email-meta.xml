    <subject>Update From Palmetto On Your Solar System - Building Inspections Scheduled - {!Opportunity.Contact__c} - {!Account.BillingAddress}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

Your local building permit office of inspections has scheduled their time to inspect your solar system {!Opportunity.Inspection_Completed_Date__c}.

After the building permit office approves of the installation, you have one final inspection from your electric utility company before we can energize your system!
