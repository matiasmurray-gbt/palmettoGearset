    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},


It’s time to Solarbrate! Permission to operate has been granted by your utility provider and it is time to energize your system. Energizing your solar system is part of the final stage in system installation. Please give us a call at 855-339-1831 at your earliest convenience and we’ll walk you through the final easy steps to energize your system.


Once your solar system is energized, you can sit back and enjoy the benefits of cleaner, cheaper and sustainable solar electricity in your home.
