Hello {!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},

Congratulations on receiving all of the approvals for your solar system. Let the countdown to installation begin! 

The next steps include: 

1) Equipment Ready 
2) Installation Scheduling 
3) Installation 

From here we just need to confirm the availability of equipment in our warehouse & schedule the installation date. We will be reaching out to let you know the schedule soon. 

Generally we will give about a week's notice of a tentative installation date just to let you know we have you on the schedule, take any scheduling requests & answer any remaining questions you might have about the installation process. 

We will call again to confirm the exact installation date no later than 24 hours before the installation date. 


Thank You,
