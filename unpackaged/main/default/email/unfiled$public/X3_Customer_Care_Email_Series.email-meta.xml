    <textOnly>Good Day {!Contact.FirstName},

We understand you have a busy schedule and want you to know we can set up a consultative phone call to speak with you before or after normal business hours.  

We here at Palmetto Solar, pride ourselves in going above and beyond what is expected of us by our customers which is why we are willing to speak with you at whatever time works best for you.
