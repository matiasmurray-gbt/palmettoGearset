    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This email is to let you know we&apos;ve received your signed contract.

The next steps are:
1) Please send either a photo or digital version of your last electric bill
2) Please send a photo of a voided check
3) Lastly, we will need to conduct a confirmation call with our financiers. Let me know what time works best for you. The call only takes a few minutes.

Thanks and let me know if you need anything.

David
