    <subject>Update From Palmetto On Your Solar System - Local Inspections Complete</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

Congratulations! Your final inspections with the local building permitting jurisdiction have all been passed. The permitting office will now be forwarding a notice to your electric utility provider, that you are ready to have your net meter installed.

The final steps include:
1) Final inspections from the utility
2) Net Meter Installed by the utility / System Energized / Monitoring Access Granted

We generally expect this process to take 2-3 weeks in total depending on how quickly the utility company is able to schedule the inspection for your system. Your utility provider will not need access to your home, as they will be able to take care of everything from outside the house.

We will follow up again after the net meter has been installed &amp; the system has been energized to get you set up with your online monitoring access &amp; give you a basic guide to your new solar system.

You should receive a welcome letter from the financing company as a primary introduction after the system installation was complete. Your first monthly payment on the solar loan will be due approximately 15 days after your solar system has been energized.

Any questions related to loan payments please feel free to contact the financing company directly. Their contact numbers should also be included in your loan documents:
