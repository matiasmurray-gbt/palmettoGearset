    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

We wanted to let you know that we have completed the final engineer&apos;s plans for your solar system &amp; have submitted the plans &amp; permit applications to the local permitting jurisdiction.

Generally this process can take between 3-5 weeks, this all depends on speed in which the building permit offices process your permit request from Palmetto.

Please bear with us as we wait for these approvals from the local jurisdiction.

The next steps include:

1) Permit Approvals
2) HOA Approvals (if necessary)
3) Interconnection Approvals
4) Equipment Ready
5) Installation Scheduling
6) Installation

As soon as we hear back on all of these approvals we will be reaching out to schedule the date for your system installation.

As always feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions along the way.



Thank You,
