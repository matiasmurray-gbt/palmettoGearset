    <subject>Update From Palmetto On Your Solar System - Installation Complete and Final Two Inspections</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

Congratulations! Your solar system has been successfully installed.

We have tested the system to ensure everything is connected &amp; working properly. The system will have to remain in the OFF position while we go through the final inspections from the local permitting jurisdiction &amp; the utility.

The final steps include:

1) Final inspections with the local jurisdiction
2) Final inspections from the utility
3) Net Meter Installed by the utility / System Energized / Monitoring Access Granted

We generally expect this process to take 3-4 weeks in total depending on how quickly they are able to get out for your inspections.

Some jurisdictions do require access to the house to perform their final inspections. In this case, you should expect to hear from us about scheduling a convenient time to meet a local inspector at your home.

Palmetto will keep you informed as you progress through these final inspections &amp; follow up again after the system has been energized to get you set up with your online monitoring access.

Congratulations again on going solar!
