    <subject>Update From Palmetto On Your Solar System - Countdown To Installation!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

Congratulations on receiving all of the approvals for your solar system. Let the countdown to installation begin!

The next steps include:

1) Equipment Ready
2) Installation Scheduling
3) Installation

From here we just need to confirm the availability of equipment in our warehouse &amp; schedule the installation date. We will be reaching out to let you know the schedule soon.

Generally we will give about a week&apos;s notice of a tentative installation date just to let you know we have you on the schedule, take any scheduling requests &amp; answer any remaining questions you might have about the installation process.

We will call again to confirm the exact installation date no later than 24 hours before the installation date.
