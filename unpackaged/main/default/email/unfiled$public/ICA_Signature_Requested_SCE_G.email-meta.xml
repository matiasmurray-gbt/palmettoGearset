    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

We have begun the application to {!Opportunity.Utility__c} for permission to interconnect your solar system to their electrical equipment.

We will be handling all aspects of this process to ensure everything is as streamlined as possible for you, but keep in mind that this is the utility’s program so we do have to follow some of their requests. We’ll be here every step of the way to handle any issues the utility may have. We will submit the necessary application fee, upload your proposed system specifications, and a copy of your home owner’s insurance (HOI). Utility providers request that the utility bill and HOI are under the same name, and will require customers to have one of the names changed if not.

Part of this process also involves your participation in electronically signing a document that should be sent to your email soon.

This email will come from: SCE&amp;G Renewable Energy (DoNotReply@powerclerk.com)

Documents to sign:

Interconnection Request Application Form
Solar Energy Program Application
IRS Form W9 Residential

Please take your time to review these documents and fill them out completely. If you have any questions please reach out to our customer care team for clarification. Once reviewed, please sign these documents with the same name that is on your most recent utility bill. Unfortunately, any submissions of these documents without the same name on the utility bill will not be accepted by the utility and will need to be signed again.

Once we have these signed documents from you, we will be able to complete and submit the application to the utility. We will monitor the status of this application, and if there are any further corrections that need to be made that require your input we will have our customer care team contact you.

Thank you,
