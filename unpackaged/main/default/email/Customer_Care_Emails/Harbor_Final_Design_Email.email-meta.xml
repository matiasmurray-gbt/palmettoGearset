Hello {!Case.Contact},


We’ve got great news: Your final design is complete!



Based on your system design, the estimated offset of your utility bill from solar and energy efficiency products is {!Case.New_Solar_Offset__c}.



The system to be installed on your home is estimated to annually produce {!Case.New_1st_Yr_K__c}kWh.


Our next step is to obtain the necessary third-party approvals, and then we’ll reach out to schedule your installation. If you have an HOA, you should have received an email with instructions on how to pursue approval for your project. Feel free to reach out to hoa@palmetto.com if you did not receive instructions, or have questions about the process. If you already have a decision from your HOA, please forward it to that same email.



You can reach us via Palmetto Home, phone or email. As always, we’re here for you. Please let us know if you have any questions as your solar journey progresses, and thank you for being a Palmetto customer!



Sincerely,



Customer Support
