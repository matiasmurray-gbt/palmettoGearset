    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},

We hope your day is going well.  We here at Palmetto wanted to provide you with an update on your current solar installation.

Now that your project has been installed, please look out for another email from your solar loan company that allows you to confirm that your system has been installed on your property.

If you have any questions please reach out to the Palmetto Customer Care Team.



Thank You,
