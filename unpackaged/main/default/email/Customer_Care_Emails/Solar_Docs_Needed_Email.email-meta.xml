    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},



We are ready to move along with the next steps in your solar installation process. However we require a few action items in order to proceed. May we please enlist your help with the following:



- Homeowner’s Insurance Declaration Page (HOI): This document is required from the utility. It details homeowner name/address, dates of coverage, and personal liability coverage amount.



- Utility Bill Copy: A copy of a recent utility bill detailing your name, address, and account number.



- Interconnection Documents E-SIGNATURE: This has been sent to your email for your E-SIGNATURE. They are standard documents required by the utility.



- Homeowner’s Association Contact Information (H.O.A.): We must obtain H.O.A. approval in order to install your system. Please let us know your H.O.A. name/contact and we will reach out to them and sent the necessary documentation


- Recent W-2 Form OR Copy of 2 Most Recent Pay-stubs: We are finalizing your loan paperwork and require these documents in order to finalize and move forward with the next steps


We can receive scanned copy OR photo to customer.care@palmetto.com

Once received, we will be able to move along with the next steps.


If we can be of any assistance, please don’t hesitate to call us directly at 855-339-1831



Thank You,
