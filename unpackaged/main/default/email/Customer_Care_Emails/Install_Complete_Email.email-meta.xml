    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact__c},



We are ready to move along with the next steps in your solar installation process. However we require a few action items in order to proceed.



May we please enlist your help with obtaining your signature on the &quot;Installation Complete&quot; documents that you should have received in your email at {!Contact.Email} .  After Palmetto receives your notification that your system has been installed on your home we can move ahead with the final two inspections.



- Inspection from the local municipality (City, County, Town, etc)

- Inspection from your utility provider



Please call your customer care representative at 855-339-1831, if you have any further questions.



Thank You,



Palmetto Customer Care Team
