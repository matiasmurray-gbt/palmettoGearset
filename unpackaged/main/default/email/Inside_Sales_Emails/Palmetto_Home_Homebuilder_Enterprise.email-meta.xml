    <subject>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} , Make Your New Homes Even Smarter!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} ,

My name is Bryan Hoffman and I work at Palmetto a clean technology company based in Charleston, SC.  We understand that energy savings are a top priority to your customers when they are purchasing a new home.

That is why we&apos;ve created Palmetto Home, a technology product that allows your customers to track their home&apos;s energy consumption down to an individual room or appliance in the home.

Palmetto Home allows you as a home builder to...
- Show your customers the real time energy savings
- Continuously show your customers the savings from their new home
- Direct communication to your customers
- Mange electrical consumption, rather than accepting it as a fixed cost
- Establish baseline measurements for you homes
- Social media connectivity,allowing your customers to share their positive experience





































I would love to setup a time to show you the Palmetto Home app in order to provide you with a visual image of what your customers would be interacting with on a daily basis.


Thank You,
