    <subject>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} , Here Is A Consumption Activity Tracker For Your Customers Homes</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} ,

My name is Bryan Hoffman and I work locally at Palmetto a clean technology company in Charleston.  We understand that energy savings are a top priority to your customers when they are purchasing a new HVAC system.

This is why we&apos;ve created Palmetto Home, a technology product that allows your customers to track their home&apos;s energy consumption down to an individual circuit within the home...or in this case their HVAC system.

Palmetto Home allows you to...
- Show your customers the real time savings from their HVAC system
- Show customers the benefits of a maintenance contract with you
- Communicate directly to your customers in order to better meet their service needs
- Mange electrical consumption, rather than accepting it as a fixed cost
- Gain actionable insights on how to improve their existing system





































I would love to setup a time to show you the Palmetto Home app in order to provide you with a visual image of what your customers would be interacting with on a daily basis.


Thank You,
