    <textOnly>Hello {!Opportunity.Contact_First_Name__c},



This is {!User.FirstName} from Palmetto Solar. We noticed you have a cancelled solar project through one of our sales partners, and have been trying to reach you about an exclusive offer for cancelled projects only.



With our new direct to consumer product,  we have seen homeowners save up to $10,000 through this offer. If you would like to see how much you could save please respond with a time &amp; best phone number for a quick 5 minute review of your original project.



Also, feel free to respond with any questions you may have, or give us a call at (843)-720-1844 ext 388.



Respectfully,

{!User.FirstName}.</textOnly>
