As you know we are currently trying to close the project inspection. We are outside of our agreed upon timelines, and Palmetto needs to ensure we provide the best possible customer experience. Due to this we have actioned another route to getting the project inspection resolved immediately.

This has cost us DOLLAR AMOUNT which we are going to clawback on the M2 payment from {!Job__c.Contact_Name__c}.

I have CC'd our accounting team for visibility and action. If you have any questions or concerns please "Reply all" to this email.
