    <subject>Palmetto Solar - We&apos;d like to Partner with &lt;Company Name&gt;</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

My name is Mike Schamp and Iâ€™m reaching out from Palmetto Solar. I&apos;m responsible for building our nationwide network of Build Partners.

We have a unique marketplace model that delivers ready-to-install projects to our Build Partners. We handle all the upfront work and provide a permit packet, design, and bill of materials. We are currently providing ready-to-install projects across more than 20 states with more than 75 current Build Partners.

We need more capacity in the {State or Region}. I would love to connect and have an introductory call to see if partnering with Palmetto makes sense for {Company Name}. If we feel like it&apos;s a good fit, I&apos;m happy to share our MSA and other resources I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find helpful. Please Use This Meeting Link to view my availability and schedule a time directly on my calendar at your earliest convenience.

Cheers,</textOnly>
