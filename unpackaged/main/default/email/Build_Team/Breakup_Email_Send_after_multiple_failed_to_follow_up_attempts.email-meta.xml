    <subject>Palmetto Solar - We&apos;d like to Partner with {Company Name}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;ve tried reaching out to you since our initial conversation back on {DATE}, with no response. Please let me know if you&apos;re still interested in partnering with Palmetto to help with the occasional Scope of work(Electrical work etc), otherwise, we&apos;ll assume you&apos;ve lost interest or are too busy with existing work to partner at this time.

Please let me know if I&apos;m mistaken, or feel free to reach out in the future when partnering is more of a priority.

Warm Regards,</textOnly>
