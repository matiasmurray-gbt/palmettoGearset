Great talking with you just now. We&apos;re excited to have you onboarded as our trenching vendor in the CITY/REGION. Please compile the following for review so we can easily reach out with work in the future.

Your insurance Carrier needs to add the following language to the Certificate of insurance for these policies.

General liability coverage for additional insured applies on a primary and non-contributory basis and includes completed operations.

Workers Compensation complies with the state statutes in which the work will be performed.
