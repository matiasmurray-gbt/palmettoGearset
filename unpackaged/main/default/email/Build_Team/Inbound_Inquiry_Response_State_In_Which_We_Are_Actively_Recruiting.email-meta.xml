    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

I hope this message finds you well. I noticed you recently expressed interest in partnering with Palmetto Solar in {STATE}. Iâ€™d like to arrange a time to discuss your interest, experience, and our build partner program? We&apos;ll need between 30 and 45 minutes to talk through everything and answer all your questions. You can Use This Meeting Link to view my availability and schedule a time directly on my calendar.

Please let me know if you have any questions or topics you&apos;d like to make sure we cover during our conversation.

Cheers,</textOnly>
