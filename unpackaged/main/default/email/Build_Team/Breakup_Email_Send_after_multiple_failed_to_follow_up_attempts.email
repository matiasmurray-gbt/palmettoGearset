Hi {!Contact.FirstName},<br><br>

I've tried reaching out to you since our initial conversation back on {DATE}, with no response. Please let me know if you're still interested in partnering with Palmetto to help with the occasional Scope of work(Electrical work etc), otherwise, we'll assume you've lost interest or are too busy with existing work to partner at this time.<br><br>

Please let me know if I'm mistaken, or feel free to reach out in the future when partnering is more of a priority.<br><br>

Warm Regards,
