Hi {!Contact.Name},<br><br>
Are you still available for our scheduled meeting together to discuss the Palmetto Build Partner Program? I'm in the zoom meeting room now, link below, please join me there if possible. Alternately, you're welcome to call my cell phone if zoom isn't a good option for you (781-439-5572). I'll hang out in the zoom meeting room for another 10 minutes or so.<br><br>

If you need to reschedule due to a conflict or another meeting running long, don't worry, use the meeting link down below to reschedule.<br>
