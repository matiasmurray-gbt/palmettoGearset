    <description>Everything that is required for this training session. Be very specific. Everything from calendar  invites sent out for training sessions to a training deck that needs to be created and/or edited. This will be OUR blueprint for creation, planning, delivery and follow up/certification process (if needed) for  the requested training session. Please make your best effort to list each item in order of priority. For example, writing a training deck  trumps sending out calendar invites as far as importance and time it takes to complete. So, please list them as such (first to last).</description>
